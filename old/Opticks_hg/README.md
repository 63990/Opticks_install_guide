# Opticks (old mercurial installation guides)
NOTE: These repos are outdated, as opticks has moved to git and there have been significant changes to the built.
Recommend following the centos7 guide in the directory above

Opticks guides for both CentOS7 and Ubuntu 18.4. 
Both were built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (VMGPU2.1).

The more complete guide is the CentOS7 guide as it includes visualisation instructions.
Though this is only valid is on a remote machine.
